* [Try a few queries on public genomic data](https://github.com/googlegenomics/getting-started-bigquery) using Google BigQuery.

_If you are ready to start coding, take a look at the list below.  But if you are
looking for a task-oriented list (e.g., "how do I analyze variants with Google Genomics"),
a better place to start is the [Google Genomics Cookbook](http://googlegenomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)._
