Documentation for Google Genomics tools
===========================================

The tools for working with the `Google Genomics API <https://developers.google.com/genomics/>`_
are all open source and available `on GitHub <https://github.com/googlegenomics>`_.

This documentation covers how to get started with the available tools as well
as how you might build your own code which uses the API.

All improvements to these docs are welcome! You can
`file an issue <https://github.com/googlegenomics/docs/issues>`_ or
submit a `pull request <https://github.com/googlegenomics/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.
