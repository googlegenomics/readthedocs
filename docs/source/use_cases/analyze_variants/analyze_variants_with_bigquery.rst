The purpose of this code lab is to help you:

* learn how to use the Google BigQuery query tool
* learn valuable BigQuery SQL syntax
* become familiar with the variants table created by a Google Genomics variant export

BigQuery uses thousands of machines in parallel to process your queries.
This means you can use it to interact with genomic data in an ad-hoc fashion.
Queries that on traditional systems take hours to run (as batch jobs) can
instead be processed in seconds with BigQuery.

This code lab focuses on genomic variant data that has been exported from Google
Genomics to BigQuery. The dataset used is from the public
`Illumina Platinum Genomes project data`_ (17 samples). You may run the same
queries against other datasets exported from Google Genomics, including:

* the `1000 Genomes project data`_
* your own data which you can `load into Google BigQuery <https://cloud.google.com/genomics/v1/load-variants>`_

All output below is for queries against the Platinum Genomes.

Here are some of the questions you'll answer in this code lab about the variant data:

* How many records are in the variants table
* How many variant calls are in the variants table
* How many variants are called for each sample
* How many non-variants are called for each sample
* How many samples are in the variants table
* How many variants are there per chromosome
* How many high-quality variants per-sample

Here are some of the technical skills you will learn:

* How to get an overview of the data in your table
* How are non-variant segments represented in the variants table
* How are variant calls represented in the variants table
* How are variant call quality filters represented in the variants table
* How to handle nested fields in variants data
* How to count distinct records
* How to group records
* How to construct queries using subqueries

BigQuery Web Interface
----------------------

So long as you have created a Google Cloud project, then you will immediately
be able to access the BigQuery web interface. Just go to
`http://bigquery.cloud.google.com <http://bigquery.cloud.google.com>`_.

On the left-hand side of the browser window you should see your Cloud project
name displayed like:

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/My_Project_left_hand_nav.png
      :width: 250 px

If you have multiple projects, be sure that the one you want the queries of
this code lab to be billed against is selected. If it is not, then click on the
down-arrow icon, select "Switch to Project" and then select the correct
project.

Add the Genomics public data project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We could immediately start composing queries against any BigQuery data you
have access to, including public datasets. But first let's add a nice
usability shortcut for accessing the Genomics public data.

On the left-hand side of the browser window:

1. Click on the down-arrow icon that is next to your project name
2. Select "Switch to Project"
3. Select "Display Project"
4. Enter "genomics-public-data" in the Add Project dialog
5. Click "OK"

On the left-hand side, you should now see a list of public genomics datasets:

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/My_Project_with_genomics_public_data.png
      :width: 250 px

Table Overview
--------------

Before issuing any queries against the data, let's take a look at some meta
information about the variants table and get familiar with it.

Table schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the left-hand side of the browser window, you should see a list of
BigQuery datasets. Select the ``genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes``.
Click on the ``variants`` table, which should appear in the drop-down.

When you have selected the table from the drop-down, you should now see the
table schema in the right-hand pane:

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/variants_table_schema.png
      :width: 95%

The key fields of the variants table that will be frequently referenced
in this code lab are:

  reference_name
    The reference on which this variant occurs. (such as "chr20" or "X")

  start
    The position at which this variant occurs (0-based). This corresponds to
    the first base of the string of reference bases.

  end
    The end position (0-based) of this variant. This corresponds to the
    first base after the last base in the reference allele. So, the length
    of the reference allele is (end - start).

  reference_bases
    The reference bases for this variant. They start at the given position.

  alternate_bases
    The bases that appear instead of the reference bases.

and

  call
    The variant calls for this particular variant.

The first set of fields are what makes a ``variant`` record unique.

The ``call`` field contains a list of the calls for the ``variant`` record.
The ``call`` field is a REPEATED field which contains NESTED fields
(REPEATED and NESTED fields are discussed further
:ref:`below <repeated-and-nested-fields>`).

The fixed NESTED fields of the call field are:

  call.call_set_id
    Unique identifier generated by Google Genomics to identify a callset.

  call.call_set_name
    Identifier supplied on input to Google Genomics for a callset.
    This is also typically known as the sample identifier.

  genotype
    Repeated field containing the numeric genotype encodings for this call.
    Values:

    * -1: no call
    *  0: reference
    *  1: first alternate_bases value
    *  2: second alternate_bases value
    *  ...
    *  n: nth alternate_bases value

  genotype_likelihood
    Repeated field containing the likelihood value for each corresponding
    genotype.

More details about other fields can be found at
`Understanding the BigQuery Variants Table Schema`_.

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Data note: 0-based positioning                                         |
   +========================================================================+
   | Note that both the start field and end fields in the variant table are |
   | 0-based. This is consistent with the GA4GH API (which Google Genomics  |
   | implements), but differs from the VCF specification in which the start |
   | column is 1-based and the end column is 0-based.                       |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

How was this table created?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The data in the Platinum Genomes variants table was created by:

1. Copying VCFs into Google Cloud Storage
2. Importing the VCFs into Google Genomics
3. Exporting the variants to Google BigQuery

More on the process can be found
`here <https://cloud.google.com/genomics/v1/load-variants>`__ on
`cloud.google.com/genomics <https://cloud.google.com/genomics>`_.

.. _repeated-and-nested-fields:

REPEATED and NESTED fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BigQuery supports REPEATED fields for lists of values and NESTED fields for
hierarchical values. These field types are useful for representing rich data
without duplication.

Two of the fields noted above, the ``alternate_bases`` and the ``call``
field, are REPEATED fields.  REPEATED fields are a feature of BigQuery
that allow for embedding multiple values of the same type into the same
field (similar to a list).

The ``alternate_bases`` field is a simple REPEATED field in that it allows
for multiple scalar STRING values.  For example:

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/repeated_fields_example.png
      :width: 85%

.. When RTD uses Sphinx 4.x, use the table below instead of an image
   Until then, using a proper table triggers
   https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/1871

   +----------------+----------+----------+-----------------+
   + reference_name | start    | end      | alternate_bases |
   +================+==========+==========+=================+
   | chr4           | 6214126  | 6214135  | - A             |
   |                |          |          | - AACAC         |
   +----------------+----------+----------+-----------------+
   | chr9           | 16011409 | 16011412 | - C             |
   |                |          |          | - CT            |
   +----------------+----------+----------+-----------------+

The ``call`` field is a complex REPEATED field in that it contains
NESTED fields (making it a hierarchical field).
The ``call`` field contains 14 nested fields, such as ``call_set_name``,
``genotype``, and ``FILTER``. Some fields, such as ``genotype`` and
``FILTER``, are themselves REPEATED fields. We will see examples of
working with these fields below.

Variants vs. non-variants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Platinum Genomes data is gVCF_ data, meaning there are records in the
variants table for non-variant segments (also known as "reference calls").
Having the reference calls in the variants table, following the
`gVCF conventions`_, "makes it straightforward to distinguish variant,
reference and no-call states for any site of interest".

   +--------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Other variant sources, besides VCFs, can contain non-variant |
   | segments, including `Complete Genomics`_ masterVar files.    |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------+

In a ``variants`` table exported from Google Genomics, the non-variant segments
are commonly represented in one of two ways (the representation depends on
the variant caller that generated the source data):

* With a NULL ``alternate_bases`` value, or
* With the text string '<NON_REF>' as the ``alternate_bases`` value

For example:

   +----------------+-------+------+-----------------+-------------------+
   | reference_name | start |  end | reference_bases | *alternate_bases* |
   +================+=======+======+=================+===================+
   |              1 |  1000 | 1010 |               A |       *<NON_REF>* |
   +----------------+-------+------+-----------------+-------------------+

or

   +----------------+-------+------+-----------------+-------------------+
   | reference_name | start |  end | reference_bases | *alternate_bases* |
   +================+=======+======+=================+===================+
   |              1 |  1000 | 1010 |               A |          *[NULL]* |
   +----------------+-------+------+-----------------+-------------------+

In this example we have a reference block of 10 bases on chromosome 1,
starting at position 1000. The reference base at position 1000 is an "A"
(the reference bases at the other positions of this block are not represented).

The Platinum Genomes data represents non-variant segments with a NULL
``alternate_bases`` value, however the queries in this code lab are designed to
accommodate either representation.

Table summary data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click on the "Details" button on the right hand side of the browser window.
This will display information like:

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/variants_table_info.png
      :width: 95%

You can immediately see the size of this table at 103 GB and over 688 million
rows, and you see a preview of a few records in the table.

Queries
-------
Now that you have an overview of data in the table, we will start issuing
queries and progressively add more query techniques and explanations of
the ``variant`` table data.

We will include many documentation references when introducing new concepts,
but you may find it useful to open the `Google BigQuery query reference`_.

How many records are in the variants table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You saw in the previous section how many variant records are in the table,
but to get your feet wet with queries, let's verify that summary data:

::

   SELECT COUNT(1) AS number_of_records
   FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]

You should see the same result as "Number of Rows" above: ``688,167,235``.

   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Code tip: COUNT(1) vs. COUNT(*) vs. COUNT(<field>)                    |
   +=======================================================================+
   | When counting records in a BigQuery table, you will want to take care |
   | when selecting whether to use the syntax "``COUNT(1)``",              |
   | "``COUNT(*)``" or "``COUNT(<field>)``".                               |
   |                                                                       |
   | Be aware that ``COUNT(NULL)`` returns ``0``. If you use the syntax    |
   | ``COUNT(<field>)``, then this can be a problem if that field contains |
   | ``NULL`` values that you wish to count.                               |
   |                                                                       |
   | When counting top-level non-repeated fields, ``COUNT(*)`` or          |
   | ``COUNT(1)`` is typically a better choice than ``COUNT(<field>)``     |
   | since ``COUNT(<field>)`` will return ``0`` for ``NULL`` values.       |
   |                                                                       |
   | When counting REPEATED fields, use ``COUNT(<field>)``. If you want to |
   | count ``NULL`` values in a repeated field, use                        |
   | ``COUNT(IFNULL(<field>, ''))``.                                       |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

How many variant calls are in the variants table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each record in the ``variant`` table is a genomic position that is a variant
or non-variant segment, and each record has within it a "repeated field",
which is list of ``calls``. Each call includes the ``call_set_name``
(typically the genomic "sample id"), along with values like the genotype,
quality fields, read depth, and other fields typically found in a VCF or
`Complete Genomics`_ masterVar file.

Let's now get a summary of total number of calls. As noted, the ``call``
field is a REPEATED field, with multiple calls embedded in each ``variant``
record. We cannot count the instances of the call field directly:

::

   SELECT COUNT(call) AS number_of_calls
   FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]

returns:

::

   Error: Field call is not a leaf field.

We have a few choices then on how we count the calls. To directly count
the instances of the ``call`` field, we are going to instruct BigQuery
to `flatten <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/data#nested>`_ the
table as it processes it (removing one level of nesting). This tells
BigQuery to treat each ``call`` as though it were a top-level record.

::

   SELECT COUNT(1) AS number_of_calls
   FROM (FLATTEN([genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants], call))

or we can use the knowledge that each call field must have a single
``call_set_name``:

::

   SELECT COUNT(call.call_set_name) AS number_of_calls
   FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]

For both of these queries, you should get a result of ``887,457,596``,
which means that there is an average of ``1.3`` calls per variant record
in this dataset.

   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Code tip: Don't FLATTEN on call                                       |
   +=======================================================================+
   | Explicit flattening of the ``call`` field significantly expands the   |
   | number of records for BigQuery to process, and is typically           |
   | unnecessary. A better pattern that is often effective is to use one   |
   | (inner) query to reduce the data set and an outer query to aggregate  |
   | over the inner query results. An example will be shown                |
   | :ref:`below <inner-outer-query-example>`).                            |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

How many variants and non-variant segments are in the table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As discussed above, the Platinum Genomes data is `gVCF`_ data, and so the
variants table contains both real variants as well as non-variant segments.

Let's now run a query that filters out the non-variant segments:

::

   SELECT COUNT(1) AS number_of_real_variants
   FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
   OMIT RECORD IF
     EVERY(alternate_bases == '<NON_REF>') OR
     EVERY(alternate_bases IS NULL)

When you issue this command, you'll observe that the number of variants
(including no-calls of variants) is ``12,379,576``. So the vast majority
of records are reference calls, which is to be expected.

   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Code tip: OMIT IF                                                     |
   +=======================================================================+
   | BigQuery provides three different filtering clauses for queries:      |
   |                                                                       |
   | - WHERE                                                               |
   | - OMIT IF                                                             |
   | - HAVING                                                              |
   |                                                                       |
   | The HAVING clause can be applied to aggregate fields of a query.      |
   | HAVING will be discussed in more detail below.                        |
   |                                                                       |
   | For filtering prior to aggregation, BigQuery's WHERE is analogous to  |
   | the traditional SQL "WHERE" clause applied to records. OMIT IF        |
   | provides additional functionality not provided by WHERE.              |
   | According to the the Query Reference:                                 |
   |                                                                       |
   |   `whereas the WHERE clause filters only the entire top-level`        |
   |   `record, the OMIT IF clause can exclude an individual element`      |
   |   `in a repeated field`                                               |
   |                                                                       |
   | This ability to filter on individual elements in a repeated field is  |
   | critical for working with records in the ``variants`` table as it     |
   | contains 11 repeated fields.                                          |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Let's turn the previous query around and get a count of the reference segments:

::

   SELECT COUNT(1) AS number_of_non_variants
   FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
   OMIT RECORD IF NOT
     (EVERY(alternate_bases IS NULL) OR
      EVERY(alternate_bases == '<NON_REF>'))

This command will return a count of ``675,787,659`` non-variant records.
This is good since:

::

   675,787,659 + 12,379,576 = 688,167,235

How many variants does each sample have called?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We've now had a quick look at the top-level records in the ``variants`` table.
Next let's look at the child records, namely the individual samples that have
had calls made against the variants.

Each variant in the ``variants`` table will have one or more
``call.call_set_name`` values. A given ``call.call_set_name`` will appear
in multiple ``variant`` records.

To count the number of ``variant`` records in which each ``callset`` appears:

::

   SELECT call.call_set_name AS call_set_name,
          COUNT(call.call_set_name) AS call_count_for_call_set
   FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
   GROUP BY call_set_name
   ORDER BY call_set_name

You should observe that there are 17 records returned.
Each ``call_set_name`` corresponds to an individual who was sequenced.

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/call_count_for_call_set.png
      :width: 60%
      :align: center

But humans don't typically have 50 million variants. Recall that the
``variants`` table contains reference calls as well, so let's filter
those out and just look at the non-reference segments, the "real"
variant records:

::

   SELECT call.call_set_name AS call_set_name,
          COUNT(call.call_set_name) AS call_count_for_call_set
   FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
   OMIT RECORD IF
     EVERY(alternate_bases == '<NON_REF>') OR
     EVERY(alternate_bases IS NULL)
   GROUP BY call_set_name
   ORDER BY call_set_name

Returns:

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/count_true_variants_per_callset.png
      :width: 60%
      :align: center

5 million variants for a human is on the right scale, but there is one
additional filter that we missed applying to our results.

.. _inner-outer-query-example:

Filter "true variants" by genotype
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Variants that were loaded into this table include "no-calls" with a
``genotype`` field value of ``-1``. These cannot be legitimately called
"true variants", so let's filter them out too.

The previous query filtered all non-variant segment records before
aggregating over the ``call`` field. We now want to filter all non-variant
segment records `and` filter all ``calls`` within the remaining variant
records.

However, the OMIT IF clause provides filtering at only one scope at a time,
so we will instead use an inner/outer query pattern as follows:

1. Inner query filters at the RECORD level and aggregates at the call level
2. Outer query filters on the aggregated call value

.. code: sql

   SELECT call_set_name, SUM(is_variant) AS call_count_for_call_set
   FROM (
     SELECT
       call.call_set_name AS call_set_name,
       SOME(call.genotype > 0) WITHIN call AS is_variant
     FROM
       [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
     OMIT RECORD IF
       EVERY(alternate_bases == '<NON_REF>') OR
       EVERY(alternate_bases IS NULL)
     )
   GROUP BY call_set_name
   ORDER BY call_set_name

Returns:

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/count_true_variants_per_callset_2.png
      :width: 60%
      :align: center

The key element in this query is:

::

    SOME(call.genotype > 0) WITHIN call AS is_variant

This transforms a REPEATABLE field (genotype) within the REPEATABLE field
(``call``) into a single value of ``true`` or ``false``. The ``is_variant``
computed field will be ``true`` only for ``call`` fields with a genotype
indicating "non-reference" (``genotype > 0``). The outer query then computes
the ``SUM`` on the ``is_variant`` computed field, using the fact that
``SUM(true)`` returns ``1`` and ``SUM(false)`` returns ``0``.

Is the non-variant segment filter actually needed here?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The above query filtered out:

* non-variant segments
* calls for which all ``genotype`` values are 0 and/or -1

There is some redundancy in this filter. All ``call.genotype`` values for
non-variant segments in this dataset are either 0, or -1.
Thus the above query could safely be rewritten with the OMIT RECORD IF
clause removed:

::

   SELECT call_set_name, SUM(is_variant) AS call_count_for_call_set
   FROM (
     SELECT
       call.call_set_name AS call_set_name,
       SOME(call.genotype > 0) WITHIN call AS is_variant
     FROM
       [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
     )
   GROUP BY call_set_name
   ORDER BY call_set_name

The first form of this query would generally be preferred as it makes the
semantic intent of the query more clear (only query over "true variant"
records). However as queries become larger and more complicated, removing
well-known redundancies can make your queries more readable.

How many samples are in the variants table?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We just observed that there are 17 distinct ``call_set_name`` values in the
``variants`` table. However our query returned 17 records, not the value 17.
What if you want to get the count of distinct ``call_set_names`` as result?

We can again use the inner/outer query pattern that is a common BigQuery
technique: use an inner query to build up aggregate results, and then use
an outer query to either *filter* based on the inner aggregation or to
*aggregate* the inner query results further:

::

   SELECT COUNT(1) AS number_of_callsets
   FROM (
     SELECT call.call_set_name
     FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
     GROUP BY call.call_set_name
   )

For more on using a subselect, see the *subselect_clause* section of the
`FROM clause`_ documentation.

The above inner/outer query pattern is frequently useful but is unnecessary
for this particular query. We can get the count of distinct ``call_set_name``
values easier ways:

::

   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT call.call_set_name) AS number_of_callsets
   FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]

This query is more compact and has a syntax similar to relational databases.
The one caveat to using this function is
`documented <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/query-reference#aggfunctions>`_
for the DISTINCT keyword:

   *Note that the returned value for* ``DISTINCT`` *is a statistical*
   *approximation and is not guaranteed to be exact.*

   *If you require greater accuracy from* ``COUNT(DISTINCT)`` *, you can*
   *specify a second parameter, n, which gives the threshold below which*
   *exact results are guaranteed.*

The ``DISTINCT`` function can be extremely useful when you do not need
exact results or you can safely bound the results by explicitly specify
the value of "n" as an upper-bound.

If you need exact results and cannot a priori bound the result, you can
use the ``EXACT_COUNT_DISTINCT`` function:

::

  SELECT EXACT_COUNT_DISTINCT(call.call_set_name) AS number_of_callsets
  FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]

How many variants are there per chromosome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We've had a look at the number of variants per callset. What if we want
to look at the number of variants per chromosome. Given our experience
with ``GROUP BY`` and ``COUNT`` from the previous section, this should
be fairly straight-forward. We just need to apply these same tools to
the ``reference_name`` field.

::

   SELECT reference_name,
          COUNT(reference_name) AS number_of_variant_records
   FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
   OMIT RECORD IF
     EVERY(call.genotype <= 0)
   GROUP BY reference_name
   ORDER BY reference_name

Returns:

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/true_variants_by_chromosome_1.png
      :width: 60%
      :align: center

In this query, we have counted variants by chromosome (``reference_name``).
To only count true variants, we have excluded variants for which all calls
are either no-calls (-1) or reference (0). This is equivalent to *including*
all variants which have some calls with genotype "alternate" (> 0).

The above is good and fairly straight-forward, but let's work on improving
our output.  What if you'd rather sort in chromosome-numeric order?
Let's walk through a few steps to demonstrate some BigQuery technique.

To sort numerically, we should first trim out the "chr" from the
``reference_name`` field:

::

   SELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(reference_name, '^chr', '') AS chromosome,
          COUNT(reference_name) AS number_of_variant_records
   FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
   OMIT RECORD IF
     EVERY(call.genotype <= 0)
   GROUP BY chromosome
   ORDER BY chromosome

What did we do here? First we used the `REGEXP_REPLACE`_
function to replace the leading "chr" string with an with an empty string,
and then we changed the ``GROUP BY`` and ``ORDER BY`` to use the computed
field. But the ordering isn't quite what we wanted:

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/true_variants_by_chromosome_remove_chr.png
      :width: 60%
      :align: center

The order is still a string rather than numeric ordering. We can simply
cast the column to an integer:

::

   SELECT INTEGER(REGEXP_REPLACE(reference_name, '^chr', '')) AS chromosome,
          COUNT(reference_name) AS number_of_variant_records
   FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
   OMIT RECORD IF
     EVERY(call.genotype <= 0)
   GROUP BY chromosome
   ORDER BY chromosome

But this reveals something wrong with the results:

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/true_variants_by_chromosome_as_integer.png
      :width: 60%
      :align: center

Not all chromosome names are numeric (X, Y, MT). This makes it challenging
to order as desired. Let's approach this slightly differently and use
string sorting but prepend a "0" to the lower-numbered chromosomes:

::

   SELECT
    CASE WHEN INTEGER(REGEXP_REPLACE(reference_name, '^chr', '')) < 10
         THEN '0' + REGEXP_REPLACE(reference_name, '^chr', '')
         ELSE REGEXP_REPLACE(reference_name, '^chr', '')
    END as chromosome,
    COUNT(reference_name) AS number_of_variant_records
   FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
   OMIT RECORD IF
     EVERY(call.genotype <= 0)
   GROUP BY chromosome
   ORDER BY chromosome

This looks better:

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/true_variants_by_chromome_pad_with_0.png
      :width: 60%
      :align: center

What did we do? We used the highly flexible `CASE function`_ to prepend a
"0" to all chromosomes numbered less than 10, and only removed the "chr"
from the remaining ``reference_name`` values.

An alternative to padding the numeric values to get the right sort order
would be to filter out the chromosomes that are not autosomes:

::

   SELECT INTEGER(REGEXP_REPLACE(reference_name, '^chr', '')) AS chromosome,
          COUNT(reference_name) AS number_of_variant_records
   FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
   WHERE reference_name NOT IN ('chrX', 'chrY', 'chrM')
   OMIT RECORD IF
     EVERY(call.genotype <= 0)
   GROUP BY chromosome
   ORDER BY chromosome

Returns:

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/true_variants_by_chrosome_only_autosomes.png
      :width: 60%
      :align: center

As a last comment on counting variants per chromosome, if instead of
ordering by chromosome, you want to order by the number of variants
per chromosome (largest values first), then just change the ``ORDER BY``
field from the original query:

::

   SELECT reference_name,
          COUNT(reference_name) AS number_of_variant_records
   FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
   OMIT RECORD IF
     EVERY(call.genotype <= 0)
   GROUP BY reference_name
   ORDER BY number_of_variant_records DESC

Returns:

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/true_variants_by_chrosome_ordered_by_count.png
      :width: 60%
      :align: center

How many high-quality variants per-sample
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `VCF specification`_ includes the ``FILTER`` field which can be used
to label variant calls of different qualities. Let's take a look at the
per-call ``FILTER`` values for the Platinum Genomes dataset:

::

   SELECT call.FILTER AS FILTER,
          COUNT(call.FILTER) AS number_of_calls
   FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
   GROUP BY FILTER
   ORDER BY number_of_calls

Returns:

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/FILTER_count.png
      :width: 60%
      :align: center

Calls with multiple FILTER values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The values for the ``number_of_calls`` seem high based on the total number
of calls. Let's sum up the ``number_of_calls`` column:

::

   SELECT SUM(number_of_calls)
   FROM (
     SELECT call.FILTER AS FILTER,
            COUNT(call.FILTER) AS number_of_calls
     FROM [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
     GROUP BY FILTER
   )

The returned result is ``939,055,789``, which is higher than the total
number of calls we computed earlier (``887,457,596``). So what is going
on here? Is our query faulty?

No. The ``FILTER`` field is a REPEATED field within each ``call`` field,
so some ``call`` fields have multiple ``FILTER`` values. Let's see a few:

::

   SELECT
     reference_name,
     start,
     end,
     reference_bases,
     call.call_set_name AS call_set_name,
     GROUP_CONCAT(call.FILTER) WITHIN call AS FILTER,
     COUNT(call.FILTER) WITHIN call AS FILTER_count
   FROM
     [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
   HAVING FILTER_count > 1
   ORDER BY FILTER_count DESC
   LIMIT 10

Returns:

   .. image:: analyze_variants_with_bigquery/calls_with_multiple_FILTER_values.png
      :width: 95%
      :align: center

So we can see that some variant calls of low quality will fail to pass
multiple filters.

There were a few new BigQuery features used in this query:

1. GROUP_CONCAT ... WITHIN
2. COUNT ... WITHIN
3. HAVING

   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Code tip: GROUP_CONCAT ... WITHIN                                     |
   +=======================================================================+
   | The `GROUP_CONCAT function`_ allows for easily creating a single      |
   | string from repeated values. It is most commonly used for             |
   | concatenating REPEATED fields together.                               |
   |                                                                       |
   | The `WITHIN keyword`_ indicates the scope of the values to            |
   | concatenate together, typically either the keyword RECORD or the name |
   | of a repeated field.                                                  |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Code tip: COUNT ... WITHIN                                            |
   +=======================================================================+
   | The `COUNT function`_ can count repeated values in multiple contexts. |
   | The `WITHIN keyword`_ indicates the scope of the values to count,     |
   | which can be over a table, a group (as created by a GROUP BY clause), |
   | within a RECORD, or within a field.                                   |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Code tip: HAVING                                                      |
   +=======================================================================+
   | The `HAVING clause`_ is used for filtering, much like the             |
   | `WHERE clause`_ and OMIT IF.                                          |
   | Where HAVING differs is in when it is evaluated. HAVING allows you to |
   | filter after aggregation, so if you want to filter against a COUNT    |
   | result, do so using the HAVING clause.                                |
   |                                                                       |
   | Note that with the late evaluation, HAVING also allows for filtering  |
   | by query field aliases, while WHERE and OMIT IF do not.               |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+


FILTERing for high quality variant records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the count of ``FILTER`` values above, we can see that the vast majority
of variant calls have been marked with the ``PASS`` label, indicating that
they are high quality calls that have passed all variant calling filters.

When analyzing variants, you will often want to filter out lower quality
variants. It is expected that if the ``FILTER`` field contains the value
``PASS``, it will contain no other values. Let's verify that:

::

  SELECT
    reference_name,
    start,
    end,
    reference_bases,
    call.call_set_name AS call_set_name,
    GROUP_CONCAT(call.FILTER) WITHIN call AS FILTER,
    COUNT(call.FILTER) WITHIN call AS FILTER_count
  FROM
    [genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants]
  OMIT call IF EVERY(call.FILTER != 'PASS')
  HAVING FILTER_count > 1
  ORDER BY FILTER_count DESC
  LIMIT 10

The result is:

   +------------------------------+
   | Query returned zero records. |
   +------------------------------+

This query omitted any call that did not contain a ``PASS`` value for
``FILTER``, and only returned calls for which there was more than 1
``FILTER`` value.
