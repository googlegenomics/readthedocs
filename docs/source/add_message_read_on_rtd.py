# If someone lands on one of our pages on github, we want to direct
# them to read the content on Read The Docs.
#
# The content on github can look incomplete, as the includes used
# are not rendered by the github viewer.
#
# To make this work, we add some reStructuredText to each page that
# is hidden on Read The Docs.
#
# We use the reStructuredText "container"
# (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#container)
# which creates a DIV with a CSS "class" of the same name.
# We then add that class to the Read The Docs CSS with attributes to hide it.
#

import os
import subprocess

# Wrap the block of text that we write in reStructuredText comments so
# that we can easily change the text here and re-run it over the docs
#
# Note that a "comment" is any unknown directive, but I have used ".. comment"
# as a convention.
